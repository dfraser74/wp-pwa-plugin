== Frequently Asked Questions ==
You’ll find an extended FAQs page on: [https://faq.worona.org](https://faq.worona.org/).

= Is Worona free? =
Yes, Worona is free and open source, and it will always be.

= Do I have to pay a monthly fee? =
No, there are no monthly fees. Worona is free unlike other WordPress plugins providing a similar service.

= How does Worona work? =
Worona consists of three fundamental parts:

*Dashboard*: an online, user-friendly dashboard to create, manage and customize your mobile apps. We’ve put everything in one place so you don’t need to install any extra tool in your computer.

*Worona plugin*: an essential requirement to make Worona work. It synchronizes our dashboard with your WordPress site.

*Mobile solutions or channels*: right now you can easily build mobile apps for free, but our plan is to integrate HTML5 web apps, Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles too.

= Why do I need Worona instead of a responsive theme?  =
You don’t have to choose between Worona or a responsive theme. Creating a website with a responsive design has become essential these days, but is no longer enough.

In Google’s report, “The Need for Mobile Speed”, they found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. Waiting for pages to load is what users dislike the most when browsing the mobile web.

Worona significantly improves your mobile site’s performance. It helps you create a fast and a smooth mobile experience in a very easy way, which means bigger audiences and more chances for engagement.

= Will you publish my mobile app to the stores? =
App submission is not included in our free product, but we offer a **premium service** to publish your Android app to the stores if you don’t want to handle this process yourself. For more information about Worona Publish service, visit [https://www.worona.org/publish](https://www.worona.org/publish).

If you don't want to use our premium service, you can always publish your app by yourself following our documentation and getting the source code of your mobile app for free.

= Can you submit my app to Apple App Store? =

Unfortunately not. Apple has become stricter about its store guidelines and we are not able to offer this service for the moment.

= Where can I find Worona documentation or a user guide? =
